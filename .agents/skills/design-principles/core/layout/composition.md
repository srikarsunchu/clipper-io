# Composition

How sections, elements, and whitespace relate to each other across a page.
For grid mechanics, see `grids.md`. For type scale by context, see `../typography/typesetting.md`.

## Core idea

Layout is typesetting at the page scale. The same logic applies: choose structure from
the content's needs and audience, not from convention. A product page for a reflective
display and a SaaS dashboard pricing page have nothing in common compositionally — they
shouldn't look like they share a template.

---

## Content-driven composition

Before choosing any layout pattern, answer two questions:

1. **What is the content's job?** — To persuade, to inform, to impress, to orient?
2. **Who is reading, and how?** — Scanning quickly, studying deeply, comparing options,
   feeling an emotion?

These answers determine the compositional approach:

| Content job | Audience mode | Compositional approach |
|-------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Persuade / inspire | Emotional, scanning | Cinematic — scale extremes, asymmetry, dramatic whitespace, type as image |
| Inform / explain | Focused, reading | Editorial — clear columns, generous measure, structured hierarchy, content leads |
| Orient / navigate | Task-driven, scanning | Functional — density, alignment lanes, minimal decoration, clarity over expression |
| Impress / showcase | Evaluative, browsing | Expressive — break the grid, unexpected scale, tension, compositional risk |

**The default should never be "centered stack."** Centering is a specific choice appropriate
for specific content (a single hero statement, a call to action in isolation). It is not a
layout strategy.

---

## Compositional principles

### 1. Section variety is non-negotiable

No two consecutive sections should share the same compositional structure. If the hero is
a large headline left-aligned with a small descriptor right, the next section should not
also be a two-column split at the same proportions.

Vary across these axes:
- **Alignment**: left-anchored → centered → right-anchored → full-bleed
- **Proportion**: 50/50 → 70/30 → full-width → contained narrow
- **Density**: spacious → dense → spacious
- **Tone**: dark → light → dark (background color as scene change)

Think of sections as scenes in a film — each needs its own framing.

### 2. Scale contrast creates hierarchy

If the largest text is 80px and the body is 16px, that's a 5:1 ratio. Good for editorial.
But if the largest text is 48px and the body is 16px, that's only 3:1 — and both feel
"medium." The page flattens.

**For brand and product pages**: aim for at least 6:1 between the largest display element
and the body text. This isn't about making everything huge — it's about making the
hierarchy unmistakable at a glance.

**For functional pages**: 3:1 to 4:1 is appropriate. The hierarchy is structural, not dramatic.

### 3. Asymmetry is the default

Symmetry communicates stability, formality, completion. It's appropriate for:
- Centered hero statements (used sparingly)
- Formal/institutional contexts
- Closing moments (final CTA)

For everything else, asymmetry creates movement, tension, and visual interest. A 60/40
split is more interesting than 50/50. A left-anchored headline with right-aligned body
creates a diagonal reading path.

**Symmetry should be a deliberate choice, not a default.**

### 4. Whitespace is compositional, not decorative

Empty space on a page is not "unused." It creates:
- **Tension**: large empty area next to dense content = dramatic
- **Direction**: whitespace pulls the eye toward content
- **Pace**: generous spacing slows reading (contemplative); tight spacing accelerates it

A 900px-tall hero section with 144px text and 500px of empty space above it is not
"wasted space" — it's cinematic pacing. The emptiness is the design.

### 5. Background color as scene change

Alternating background colors between sections is one of the most powerful compositional
tools. It creates:
- Visual separation without borders or dividers
- Pacing and rhythm across the page
- Opportunities for contrast (light text on dark, dark text on light)

**Dark sections demand different typography.** Light text on dark backgrounds should be
slightly lighter weight than dark text on light backgrounds — the optical weight differs.

### 6. Break the grid intentionally

A grid provides structure. Breaking it provides emphasis. Both are necessary.

When to break:
- A hero image that bleeds full-width while text is contained
- A pull quote that extends wider than the body column
- A large number or word that overlaps its container
- An element positioned to create diagonal tension with another

**Every grid break must be clearly intentional.** One element slightly off-grid looks like
a mistake. One element dramatically off-grid looks like a decision.

---

## Anti-patterns

These are not "rules to never break" — they are defaults to avoid. Each is acceptable in
the right context, but none should be the automatic first choice.

### The centered stack
```
        [Label]
    [Large Heading]
  [Body paragraph text]
     [Button] [Button]
```
This is the most common landing page template — and the single most common failure mode
in agent-generated hero sections. Centered text above a full-width image is the default
that every template produces. It fails the composition test: *"Would a designer look at
this and know it wasn't a template?"* Almost never.

**When it works:** A closing CTA, a manifesto statement, or a single moment of
symmetrical calm between asymmetric sections. Never as the hero — the hero is the
page's first impression and must demonstrate compositional intent.

**When it fails:** As a hero section. As the organizing principle for an entire page.
As the default when no other idea comes to mind — that's the signal to stop and sketch.

**Hero alternatives that demonstrate intent:**
- Asymmetric split: text anchored left at extreme scale, product image offset right
- Overlap/bleed: product image breaks into the text zone, creating depth
- Typographic hero: product name at extreme scale (120px+) with text wrapping around
  or flowing beside a contained product image
- Edge-anchored: text and CTA pushed to one side with the product owning the other 60%
- Vertical offset: text high with dramatic whitespace, product image below at an
  unexpected crop or angle

[updated after a session where the centered stack anti-pattern was acknowledged in the
brief but built anyway — the previous wording gave permission for hero use]

### The three-card grid
Three equal cards in a row is the default "features section." It communicates
"we have three things" but nothing about the relative importance of those things, and
nothing about the brand's visual identity.

**Alternatives:**
- One large feature (2/3 width) + two stacked smaller features (1/3 width)
- Sequential reveals — one feature per section, each with its own compositional treatment
- **Horizontal carousel** — each item gets its own full moment; works especially well for
  4+ peer items with rich/atmospheric imagery. Avoids the grid monotony problem entirely.
  Should always be a named candidate when presenting N items of equal importance.
- Asymmetric mosaic with ratio-derived proportions (see below and `../foundations/math.md`)
- No cards at all — features as editorial text blocks with typographic hierarchy

### The uniform section rhythm
Every section has the same padding, same internal structure, same alignment. The page
reads as a list, not a composition.

**Fix:** Vary section height, padding, and internal layout deliberately. Some sections
should be tall and spacious (contemplative). Others should be compact and dense
(informational). The rhythm should feel scored, not metronomic.

### The equal spec strip

N items, same size, same weight, evenly spaced in a row with labels beneath.
The most templated section pattern in product page design. Treats all data points
as equally important when they rarely are.

**The fix isn't a specific alternative — it's asking better questions:**
- Which of these specs matters most? Give it dominance through scale.
- Can these specs live inside the sections they belong to instead of being
  extracted into their own section?
- Does the hierarchy serve the reader, or does it serve the layout's symmetry?

Any presentation that differentiates by importance — through scale, grouping,
or integration into narrative content — will outperform equal repetition.

### Medium everything
All headings between 32–48px, all body at 16px, all spacing at 40–60px. Nothing is
notably large or notably small. The page has no visual peaks or valleys.

**Fix:** Push at least one element to an extreme — a 120px+ headline, a 200px ghost
number, a full-bleed image, a section with 140px padding. Create peaks.

---

## Context scales (compositional)

### Brand / Product page
- Hero type: 96–160px
- Section headings: 36–56px
- Body: 15–17px
- Section padding: 80–140px, varied
- At least one dark section
- At least one full-bleed moment
- Asymmetric by default

### Editorial / Article
- Display type: 48–80px
- Section headings: 24–36px
- Body: 16–18px in a constrained measure (55–75ch)
- Section padding: 48–80px, consistent
- Content-led — images and pull quotes break the column
- Clear reading flow is the priority

### Product UI / Dashboard
- Page title: 24–32px
- Section headings: 18–20px
- Body: 14–15px
- Section padding: 24–40px, compact
- Alignment lanes and density over expression
- Symmetry is acceptable here — it communicates order

## Component architecture — establish a vocabulary, then arrange it

Section variety (principle 1 above) governs how sections *differ*. Component architecture
governs what they *share*. Both are necessary. A page where every section invents its own
internal structure feels fragmented — like six designers worked on six sections. A page
with a consistent component vocabulary but varied arrangements feels cohesive and intentional.

### Vary arrangement, not structure

The key distinction: **components** are the reusable building blocks (cards, content blocks,
feature items, media blocks). **Arrangement** is how those components sit on the page
(asymmetric grid, stacked, side-by-side, full-bleed). Vary the arrangement per section.
Keep the component vocabulary tight.

A card that appears at 2/3 width in the features section and at 1/3 width in the security
section is the same component at different scales — that's cohesion. A features section
using horizontal rows while the security section uses vertical cards with completely
different padding, radius, and type hierarchy — that's fragmentation.

### Define the component vocabulary early

Before writing HTML, name 2-4 component types the page will use. Each gets:
- **Shared surface treatment**: background color, border-radius, padding
- **Shared type hierarchy**: how heading, description, and metadata relate inside the block
- **A size range**: can it flex from 1/3 to full-width? Or is it fixed?

Example vocabulary for a product page:
- **Feature card**: rounded surface, padding-32, heading + description + optional image
- **Content block**: no surface (lives on the section background), number + heading + description
- **Media block**: image with optional caption overlay

Three components, arranged differently per section, is enough for most pages.

### Content containment — when to use cards

Cards (contained surfaces with background, padding, radius) are appropriate when:
- Content items are **peers** that need visual equivalence (features, pricing tiers)
- Items contain **mixed media** (image + text together inside a boundary)
- The section background is busy or dark and items need a **reading surface**

Cards are not appropriate when:
- Content is a **linear sequence** (steps, timeline, specs list) — use flat list patterns
- Items are **subordinate to a primary element** (supporting details under a heading)
- The section is already a clean reading surface — adding card backgrounds creates
  visual noise without structural benefit

The default instinct to "put it in a card" often comes from uncertainty about layout.
If the content can live directly on the surface with clear typographic hierarchy, it
should. Cards are for containment, not decoration.

### Asymmetric card grids over equal grids

When using cards, prefer asymmetric arrangements:
- **One large (2/3) + two stacked small (1/3)** — creates hierarchy within a set of peers
- **One full-width hero card + row of compact cards below** — establishes importance
- **Staggered sizes** — large, medium, small in a masonry-like flow

Equal-size card grids (three 1/3 cards in a row) are the most common anti-pattern in
agent-generated designs. They communicate "we have three things" without signaling
which matters most. If the items genuinely are equal, vary the *internal* treatment
(one gets an image, the others are text-only) to avoid visual monotony.

### Peer items need equal visual weight

When content items are genuine peers (6 capabilities, 4 pricing tiers, 5 team members),
the layout must give them equal visual weight — even if the arrangement is asymmetric.
Asymmetry in a mosaic grid (varied widths, different crops) is fine because each item
still gets its own image and label at the same typographic level. But giving one item a
hero treatment (larger type, more description, a decorative number) while the others get
compact treatment creates false hierarchy — it tells the reader this item matters more
when the content says they're equal.

**The test:** if you swapped the content between the "hero" slot and a "secondary" slot,
would the design still make sense? If not, the layout is imposing hierarchy the content
doesn't have. [added after a session where an "editorial cascade" layout gave one of six
equal capabilities a hero split with an oversized number, making it feel like the primary
feature when all six were peers]

### Asset character drives composition

The same content with different images demands different layouts. Clinical product shots
on clean backgrounds work with card+list and structured grid layouts — the images are
informational. Atmospheric, in-context photography (hands playing an instrument, moody
studio lighting, performance shots) demands image-first layouts — mosaics, bleeds,
overlays — because the images carry emotional weight that structured grids suppress.

**Before choosing a layout pattern, look at the images.** If they're atmospheric and
diverse, the composition should let them dominate (mosaic, carousel, full-bleed). If
they're uniform product shots, the composition can be more structured (cards, grids).
The layout decision depends on what images you have, not just what content you have.
[added after a session where switching from product shots to atmospheric photography
completely changed the right approach from card+list to mosaic]

### Variant axes — design every component on three axes

Once a component vocabulary is named, each component is defined along three axes. This
is the design-thinking equivalent of React props — a working spec, not source code, but
designed so it maps cleanly when the design lands in code.

| Axis | Typical values | What it controls |
|------|---------------|------------------|
| **Size** | sm / md / lg (or numeric: 32 / 40 / 48) | Padding, type size, hit area, icon size |
| **Tone** | primary / secondary / ghost / destructive | Background, text color, border treatment |
| **State** | default / hover / focus / active / disabled / loading / error / success | See `../ui/states.md` for the full spectrum and which states matter per component |

Add a fourth axis only when the component genuinely needs it (e.g. selected/unselected
for a chip, expanded/collapsed for a row). Resist the urge to multiply variants — most
components need 2 sizes, 2 tones, and the standard state set.

**Render variants visibly in the system spec.** Show every (size × tone) intersection
side-by-side with labels — not a single "Button" example. The variant matrix is the
spec. A reader should be able to answer "what does the small ghost button look like" by
pointing, not by interpolating.

### Slots — composition through named openings

A slot is a named opening in a component where caller content goes. Slots are how
components stay reusable without becoming a soup of props.

Common slots on mobile components:
- **Leading** — icon, avatar, thumbnail, indicator (left side)
- **Trailing** — chevron, action, badge, count (right side)
- **Title** — primary label
- **Subtitle / meta** — secondary label or metadata row
- **Action** — interactive element distinct from the row's own tap target

Per row hygiene: leading and trailing slots take **fixed widths with `flexShrink: 0`**
even when empty. This is the same vertical-lane rule from the Paper guide — repeated
rows that rely on `gap` alone for column alignment will break the moment one row's
content varies.

**Slot rules:**
- Components define their slots; callers fill them. Don't invent slot names per usage.
- Empty slots collapse to zero or hold a fixed-width placeholder — they never reflow
  the rest of the row.
- A slot with two purposes (e.g. "this trailing slot is sometimes a badge and sometimes
  an action") is two slots; name them differently or split the component.

### Asset integration — images inside components, not beside them

Product images embedded *inside* a card or content block feel structural — the image
is part of the component's content. Product images placed *beside* a text block feel
decorative — they illustrate rather than integrate.

For product pages: prefer structural integration. A feature card with the product
screenshot inside it, text below, communicates "this is what the feature looks like."
The same screenshot floating next to a text block communicates "here's a picture, and
here's some text." The first approach is stronger.

When an image IS the content (hero product shots, portfolio pieces), it should own its
space — full-width or dominant in an asymmetric split. When an image SUPPORTS the
content (showing what a feature does, demonstrating a detail), embed it inside the
content component. [added after a session where a product landing page treated all
images as side-by-side decorations rather than integrating them into feature cards,
creating a page that looked like a brochure with illustrations rather than a product
page with demonstrations]

## Ratio-derived mosaic grids

When building an asymmetric image grid or mosaic, derive proportions from a single ratio —
don't improvise splits per row. Eyeballed proportions (7/5, then 4/8, then 6/3/3) create
visual noise because the relationships between rows are arbitrary.

**Method:**
1. Choose a ratio from `../foundations/math.md` — Golden Section (1.618), Root-2 (1.414),
   or Perfect Fifth (1.5) work well for image grids
2. Derive the primary split: e.g. Golden Section on 12 columns = ~7.4/4.6, round to 7/5
3. Subdivide the minor portion by the same ratio for the next row, or invert the split
4. Offsets and staggers should come from the spacing system (multiples of 8px), not arbitrary

**Example — Golden Section mosaic on 1312px content width (1440 - 128px margins):**
```
Row 1:  810px (major) + 16px gap + 486px (minor)     — 1.667:1
Row 2:  486px (minor) + 16px gap + 810px (major)     — inverted
Row 3:  500px + 16px + 300px + 16px + 180px           — subdivide further
```

The key: proportions should *rhyme* across rows. When a viewer can't articulate why a
mosaic feels composed rather than scattered, it's usually because the proportions share
a mathematical ancestor. [added after a session where improvised mosaic splits produced
a scattered-feeling grid]

**Stagger rule:** Do not use vertical offsets (margin-top, margin-bottom) to stagger
images within a mosaic row. Tops should align within a row. Asymmetry comes from width
proportions (Golden Section splits) and height variation between rows — not from offsets
within a row. Staggers look like broken alignment, not intentional movement. [added
after a 48px stagger was removed because it looked like a bug]

---

## Layout sketch — mandatory pre-build step

Before writing any HTML, write a **layout sketch**: one sentence per section describing
the specific compositional structure — not the content, the *spatial arrangement*.

A good layout sketch sentence is actionable and auditable:
- Bad: "Hero section — cinematic, dramatic whitespace"
- Good: "Hero text overlaps the product image at the midpoint, breaking the grid;
  CTA anchored bottom-left with 140px breathing room above"

Bad sketches use adjectives (cinematic, clean, bold). Good sketches use spatial
relationships (overlaps, anchored, bleeds, offset by, spans 8 of 12 columns).

**If you can't describe the layout in spatial terms, you haven't designed it yet —
you're about to default to a template.** This is the single most common failure mode
in agent-generated layouts. [added after a session where a brief calling for "cinematic
composition" produced centered stacks and equal-card grids]

---

## Composition checklist

Before finalizing a page layout:

- [ ] Can you describe each section's compositional strategy in one sentence?
- [ ] Do any two consecutive sections share the same structure? (They shouldn't.)
- [ ] Is there at least one moment of extreme scale (very large or very small)?
- [ ] Is centering used sparingly and intentionally, not as the default?
- [ ] Does the whitespace rhythm vary — some sections spacious, some dense?
- [ ] Is there a background color or tonal shift creating visual pacing?
- [ ] Would a first-time viewer know this is a designed page, not a template?

### Post-build composition audit

After the first build pass, screenshot the full page and ask:

> "Would a designer look at this and know it wasn't a template?"

If the answer is no — or even "maybe" — identify the weakest section and redesign it
before moving on. The audit is not optional. A page that passes the checklist above
but still *feels* like a template has a composition problem that the checklist didn't
catch — usually uniform section rhythm or lack of a genuine scale peak. [added after
a session where a checklist-passing page still read as generic]
